This application uses mongoDB, mongoose.js, Express, Node.js and Handlebars.js on the backend. In addition it strictly adheres to the mvc format! On the front end I used a combination of CSS and jQuery.

This is a full stack application that allows users to scrape all the most current real estate news off The Real Deal's website. In addition, users can add notes to important articles in their saved articles page. Both the articles and the notes can be removed from the saved section and deleted forever!
